```
install-build-tools            Install required tools for build/dev

test                           Run tests
clean                          Clean all build artifacts
release-validate               Validate that a distribution will render properly on PyPI
release-test                   Release a new version, uploading it to PyPI Test
release                        Release a new version, uploading it to PyPI
bump-version-patch             Bump patch version, e.g. 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2

Refer to the `Makefile` to see details about the different tasks.


### Testing

Run tests for all python distributions using
```sh
make test
```

This will require that your dev machine has the required python distributions installed locally.
(You can install python distributions using [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).)


## Releasing

*Prerequisites:*
You will need to register accounts on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/) and [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/).

Before releasing, make sure you're working on a "new" version number. You can bump the version using the [bumpversion tool](https://medium.com/@williamhayes/versioning-using-bumpversion-4d13c914e9b8).

Also, make sure to update release notes.

To release and publish a new version to PyPI:
```sh
make release-validate
```

This will run tests, build distribution packages and perform some rudimentary PyPI compliancy checking.

For a dress rehearsal, you can do a test release to the [TestPyPI index](https://test.pypi.org/). TestPyPI is very useful, as you can try all the steps of publishing a package without any consequences if you mess up. Read more about TestPyPI [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/).

```sh
make release-test
```

To perform the actual release, run:
```sh
make release
```

You should see the new release appearing [here](https://pypi.org/project/ssb-pseudonymization) (it might take a couple of minutes for the index to update).
